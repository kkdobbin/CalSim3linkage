- **Fraction of Total Annual Water Supply**: 25%
- **Notes**: The imported water is treated at MWD's treatment plants before being blended with locally produced water and distributed to residents.

### Summary
- **Local Groundwater**: 75% of total supply, sourced from Charnock, Olympic, and Arcadia Sub-basins.
- **Imported Water (MWD)**: 25% of total supply, sourced from the Colorado River and State Water Project.

This summary reflects the reliance of the Santa Monica water system on both local and imported water sources to meet the community's drinking water needs.

### Additional Notes:
- The report indicates the water system utilizes both groundwater and imported surface water, but it does not specify the exact contributions of each source as a fraction of the total water supply. Further information would be needed to quantify these contributions accurately.


Based on the Consumer Confidence Report for the City of Lakewood, the water system relies on the following water sources:

### Water Source Summary

1. **Source Type:** Groundwater
   - **Where It Comes From:** Local deep groundwater wells within the service area of the City of Lakewood.
   - **Fraction of Total Annual Water Supply:** 100%
   - **Notes:** The City of Lakewood operates 11 deep wells that supply all the drinking water for the area. There are no other sources mentioned, indicating that the entire water supply is derived from groundwater.
