- **Fraction of Total Annual Water Supply**: Represents **25%** of the total annual water supply.
- **Notes**: The imported water is filtered at MWD treatment plants before being blended with locally produced water and distributed to residents.

### Summary of Water Sources
- **Local Groundwater**: 75% (Groundwater from Charnock, Olympic, and Arcadia Sub-basins)
- **Imported Water**: 25% (Surface Water from Colorado River and State Water Project via MWD)

These sources are part of Santa Monica's efforts to ensure a sustainable and high-quality water supply for its residents, with ongoing investments in water infrastructure and advanced treatment technologies.
