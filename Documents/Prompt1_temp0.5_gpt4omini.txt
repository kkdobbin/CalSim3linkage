   - **Fraction of Total Annual Water Supply:** 25% (0.25)

### Relevant Notes:
- The City of Santa Monica has been working towards reducing reliance on imported water by enhancing local groundwater production and developing sustainable water sources.
- The Charnock Sub-basin has been a local supply since 1924 and has undergone restoration projects to address contamination issues from compounds like MTBE.
- The report emphasizes a commitment to sustainable water management and conservation efforts to ensure a reliable water supply for the community.


**Water System Name:** City of Commerce Water System  
**Public Water System ID (PWSID):** Not explicitly provided in the text.  
**Year of the Report:** 2023  

### Water Sources Identified:

1. **Source Type:** Groundwater  
   **Where it Comes From:** Local groundwater (specifically from two active wells).  
   **Annual Supply Fraction:** 0.5 (50% of the total annual water supply).  
   **Notes:** The groundwater is part of the system's infrastructure, which includes booster pumps and storage tanks.

2. **Source Type:** Purchased Water  
   **Where it Comes From:** Purchased from the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWD), which sources its water from the Colorado River and the State Water Project in northern California.  
   **Annual Supply Fraction:** 0.5 (50% of the total annual water supply).  
   **Notes:** The water system has a connection to MWD through the Central Basin Municipal Water District (Central Basin MWD). 

### Summary:
The City of Commerce Water System relies on two sources for its water supply, with local groundwater and purchased water from MWD each contributing 50% to the total annual water supply.


**Water System Information**
- **Water System Name:** Littlerock Creek Irrigation District
- **Public Water System ID (PWSID):** Not provided in the report
- **Year of Report:** 2023

**Water Sources Identified:**

1. **Source Type:** Groundwater
   - **Where it comes from:** Antelope Valley Ground Water Basin, Littlerock, CA
   - **Fraction of Total Annual Water Supply:** Since no specific percentage is provided, we assume this source makes up all of the water system's annual water supply (1.0).

2. **Source Type:** Imported Surface Water
   - **Where it comes from:** State Water Project (SWP)
   - **Fraction of Total Annual Water Supply:** Since no specific percentage is provided, we assume this source makes up all of the water system's annual water supply (1.0).

**Notes:**
- The report indicates that both groundwater and imported surface water are used, but does not provide specific percentages for each source. Therefore, we cannot accurately assign fractions of the total supply to each source beyond stating that they are both utilized.
- The groundwater source is specifically from the Antelope Valley Ground Water Basin, while the imported surface water is sourced from the State Water Project. 

If further information on the distribution of water sources were provided, more precise fractions could be determined.


**Water System Name:** City of Lakewood  
**Public Water System ID (PWSID):** CA1910239  
**Year of Report:** 2023  

### Water Sources Identified:

1. **Source Type:** Groundwater  
   **Where it Comes From:** Local, deep groundwater wells. The City of Lakewood is responsible for providing water services for residents and businesses west of the San Gabriel River.  
   **Fraction of Total Annual Water Supply:** 100% (since only one source is identified).
