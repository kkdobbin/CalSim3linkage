The water system's Public Water System ID (PWSID) is ", file_list[i,1],". The report is for the year ", file_list[i,3]," the report includes information on the sources of water utilized by the water system and the quality of water provided to customers that year. Your job is to read the report, identify the water sources that the water system relies on and then provide me with a summary that includes the following information for each water source, 1) the source type (groundwater, surface water or recyled water); 2) where it comes from (including who it is purchased from and/or where it is diverted or sourced from (e.g. canal, reservoir, stream)); and 3) How much of the systems total annual water supply that source represents as a fraction of 1. Include any relevant notes about the origin or quantity of the sources you identify. For surface water soruces, include any provided details about the locations, name or type of infrastructure used to move or treat the surface water (e.g. name of water treatment plant, name of acqueduct, address or geographic location of diversion etc.) Do not infer to make these determinations, use only the information provided in the text. Sometimes reports do not have enough information to answer these questions. Start your response with a header that includes the water system name, PWSID and report year that I provided you, then format your answers for each water source consistently following this format:

Water system name (PWSID)
CCR report year

**Where It Comes From**:
